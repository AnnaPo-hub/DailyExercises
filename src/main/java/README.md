Hello!

Here you can see my daily Java  exercises. 

One of the projects that I'm working on in JetBrains Academy situates in the coffeeMachine package. 

This is  a program that  simulates  a coffee machine. It has a limited supply of everything.
Also it counts how much money it gets for selling coffee.
The coffee machine has several options: 1) it needs to be able to sell coffee (espresso, latte, cappuccino).
2) the coffee machine should be able to get replenished by a special worker
3) another special worker should be able to take money from the coffee machine.
Program can do one of these actions at a time.
